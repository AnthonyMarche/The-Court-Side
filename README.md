# Project 3 Symfony - Origins Digital - The Court Side

## Presentation

This is our third and final project at the Wild Code School. The team is composed of Alexis Boucherie, Anthony March√©, Yazid Hamzi and Naomie Atil. We are part of the PHP course.
Our client desired a user-friendly website with an intuitive design.

The Court Side is a direct-to-consumer video content free platform specialized in sports where the users need to register in order to access the premium content.

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional library (webpack, fixtures) and tools to validate code standards.
